# PyGuard Desktop App - Features Added

## 1. Deep Protocol Inspection
We've enhanced the desktop application with deep protocol inspection capabilities for various network protocols:

- **Ethernet Layer**: MAC addresses, frame types
- **IP Layer**: IPv4 and IPv6 support, header fields, TTL/hop limit
- **TCP Layer**: Ports, sequence numbers, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST, etc.)
- **UDP Layer**: Ports, length
- **ICMP**: Types and codes
- **ARP**: Operation types, hardware and protocol addresses
- **DNS**: Queries and responses, domain names
- **HTTP**: Request and response parsing, headers
- **TLS/SSL**: Detection based on port numbers

The implementation uses Scapy for packet parsing and provides detailed metadata extraction for each protocol layer.

## 2. Wireshark-like UI with Summary and Detailed Inspection

We've completely redesigned the UI to provide a Wireshark-like experience:

- **Packet List**: Table view showing packet number, timestamp, source, destination, protocol, length, and summary
- **Protocol-specific Coloring**: Different colors for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP packets
- **Packet Details Tree**: Hierarchical view of all protocol layers and fields
- **Hex View**: Raw packet data in hexadecimal format
- **Raw Data View**: Text representation of packet payloads
- **Toolbar**: Quick access to common functions
- **Status Bar**: Real-time statistics and memory usage

## 3. Handling Heavy Traffic

We've implemented several optimizations to handle high-volume traffic efficiently:

- **Packet Queue**: Asynchronous processing with a queue to decouple capture from display
- **Batch Processing**: Process packets in batches to reduce UI updates
- **Display Limits**: Configurable maximum number of packets to display
- **Memory Management**: Monitor and display memory usage
- **Progress Indicators**: Show queue size and processing status
- **Efficient UI Updates**: Temporarily disable UI updates during batch processing
- **Packet Sampling**: Option to process only a subset of packets for very high traffic rates

## 4. Additional Features

- **Packet Filtering**: Real-time filtering of displayed packets
- **Packet Export**: Save captured packets in PCAP, JSON, or CSV formats
- **Capture Controls**: Start, stop, and clear capture
- **Interface Selection**: Choose network interface for capture
- **BPF Filters**: Apply Berkeley Packet Filter expressions
- **Packet Statistics**: Real-time counters for different protocols
- **Log View**: Integrated logging for troubleshooting

## Implementation Notes

- The features work on both frontend (UI) and backend (packet processing)
- We've used PyQt5 for the UI components
- Scapy is used for packet capture and protocol parsing
- The application follows a multi-threaded architecture to keep the UI responsive
- We've implemented fallback to simulation mode when real packet capture isn't available

## Future Improvements

- Add more protocol dissectors (e.g., DHCP, SMTP, FTP)
- Implement packet reassembly for fragmented packets
- Add flow tracking and conversation analysis
- Implement packet search functionality
- Add packet editing and replay capabilities
- Improve performance with native packet processing libraries
